The learning objective of this lab is to see how VPN works in action and how VPN can help bypass egress firewalls. 

I implemented a very simple VPN in this lab, and used it to bypass firewalls.

A typical VPN depends on two pieces of technologies: IP tunneling and encryption.

Lab environemnt: LINUX/UNIX - #Ubuntu
